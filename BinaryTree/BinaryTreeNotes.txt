1. offer():
    Purpose: Inserts an element into the priority queue or heap.
    Similar to: add()
    Behavior:
    In a priority queue, offer() adds the element according to the queue's ordering rules.
    Returns true if the element was added successfully, and false if the queue's capacity is limited and cannot accept more elements.


2. poll():
    Purpose: Retrieves and removes the head (the smallest or highest-priority element) of the priority queue or heap.
    Similar to: remove()
    Behavior:
    Removes the head of the queue and returns it.
    Returns null if the queue is empty.

Key Differences:

    offer() vs. add():
    offer() is generally used in queues with fixed capacities, where it gracefully handles full queues by returning false.
    add() throws an exception if it can't add the element due to capacity constraints.
    
    poll() vs. remove():
    poll() returns null if the queue is empty, while remove() throws an exception.
